# OOP Assignments – Gdańsk University of Technology

This repository contains proposed solutions for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignments from **Gdańsk University of Technology**.

## 📁 Repository Structure
The repository is organized into four directories, each corresponding to a different laboratory assignment. 
Each folder contains source code that implements the required OOP concepts.
The solutions follow best practices in C++/Java and adhere to the standards expected for each lab assignment.
```
OOP-assignments/
├── Lab1 # Laboratory #1 files
├── Lab2 # Laboratory #2 files
├── Lab3 # Laboratory #3 files
├── Lab4 # Laboratory #4 files
├── .gitignore # Git ignored files
└── README.md # Project documentation
```

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Language:** C++/Java
- **IDE:** CLion / IntelliJ IDEA
- **Build System:** CMake for C++ assignments

## 📌 Notes
- This repository is designed to help students learn and understand core **Object-Oriented Programming concepts**.
- The solutions aim to demonstrate core **OOP principles** such as **encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction**.
- If you find any issues or have suggestions, feel free to **open an issue** or submit a **pull request**.
- Remember that these solutions are just **my proposed implementations** and one of many possible correct approaches to solving the tasks—there are always other valid ways to achieve the same results.
