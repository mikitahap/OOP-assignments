# OOP Assignments – Gdańsk University of Technology

This repository contains proposed solutions for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignments from **Gdańsk University of Technology**.

📁 Repository Structure
The repository is organized into four directories, each corresponding to a different laboratory assignment. Each folder contains:

1. Source code that implements the required OOP concepts.
2. The laboratory requirements PDF file.
3. The solutions follow best practices in C++/Java and adhere to the standards expected for each lab assignment.

## 📜 Assignments
Below are links to the original assignment descriptions:

1. [Lab 1 – Description](Lab1/OOP_lab1.pdf)
2. [Lab 2 – Description](Lab2/OOP_lab2.pdf)
3. [Lab 3 – Description](Lab3/OOP_lab3.pdf)
4. [Lab 4 – Description](Lab4/OOP_Lab4.pdf)

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Language:** C++/Java
- **IDE:** CLion / IntelliJ IDEA
- **Build System:** CMake for C++ assignments

## 📌 Notes
- The solutions aim to demonstrate core **OOP principles** such as **encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction**.
- If you find any issues or have suggestions, feel free to **open an issue** or submit a **pull request**.
- Remember that these solutions are just **my proposed implementations** and one of many possible correct approaches to solving the tasks—there are always other valid ways to achieve the same results.
